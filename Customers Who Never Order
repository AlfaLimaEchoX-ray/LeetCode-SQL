# Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything

SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Orders.CustomerId=Customers.Id
WHERE Customers.Id NOT IN
  (SELECT CustomerID 
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY CustomerId);

#We left join orders because we only want the customers who are in the first table but not second.
#We use NOT IN with WHERE clause to show we only want customers who are not in the orders table (did not place the order)
